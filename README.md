### What to expect from our hiring process.
We are told over and over again our hiring approach is relaxed and enjoyable—I know, is that even possible?—Give us a try if you feel a connection.

1. **CV review:** *We don't mind how you learnt software, university or self-taught. It's about your passion and ability to understand what writing software is about.*
2. **Quick and simple phone interview:** *Back up what you have written on your CV. Explain in your words what you are looking for, and we will do the same.*
3. **Home coding assessment:** *Written in language required, with no deadline imposed, allowing you to produce the best clean code you can.*
4. **A relaxed face to face interview:** *Meet several of the development team, some pairing, refactoring, perhaps a new feature implementation.*
